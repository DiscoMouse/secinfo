This is code in Golang that will read a csv file and generate updated markdown files to be displayed on https://github.com/infosecstreams/infosecstreams.github.io/

## Development

Check the `Makefile` for all options but you've got `make {docs,test,cover,clean,build,docker-build,docker-run}` available to you.

When running `docker-run`, we assume you're providing `streamers.csv` from the infosecstreams repo. You can check the invocation of the `docker run ...` command in the Makefile for further details.

## Usage

Ensure there's a `streamers.csv` in the CWD of the secinfo binary.
You can optionally provide an existing index.md file to be updated
The tool should do its best to main the online/offline status during the update.

This is ideally ran in the infosecstreams repo as part of a time-based GitHub Actions workflow. That workflow should run that docker container generated by this repo.
